### Version 2.0.0
This is a major rework of the project structure to make it more extensible in the future.

# Backboard Updater
This repository contains a script that automatically updates the Supabase database for the Backboard website. This was designed to run similar to a cron job on a private server.

### Installation
Not yet supported. This is publicly available primarily for reference and for the development of the fetchers. If you would like to get this working for you, you would need to create your own Supabase database and set up the necessary tables and add your creds to a .env file.
